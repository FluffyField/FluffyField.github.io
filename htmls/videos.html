                    I have conjoured up some videos you may find simply <b><i>sensational</i></b>
                    <i>(In other words just YouTube video recommedations)</i>.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Alot of these are going to be video essays because you can watch them while doing house cleaning and etc, 
                    so that tends to be the time that I actually find some use for YouTube.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Be sure to check these videos out by clicking the titles, they are links!!!

                    Best Deltarune video essay, <b><i>period.</i></b>
                    Combining something as interesting as philosophy with something I love like Deltarune is just sensational. 
                    A concept like a Body Without Organs, in essence being a "virtual body of pure potentiality",
                    is something genuinely intriguing and interesting!

                    <i>Okay fine it's actually a tie for the best Deltarune video essay...</i>
                    <br/><br/>
                    The fourth wall is something that has probably been talked and done to death,
                    but trust me this video is great!!!
                    There is a reason why so many games and some media break the fourth wall or do something with it,
                    <b><i>because the idea of a fourth wall is interesting as hell!!!</i></b>

                    <i>Yes, she deserves her own section.</i> 
                    There are multiple video essays that are my favourite but I'll just recommend this one though.
                    I watch the Undertale Retrospective almost every time I get cozy like on Christmas. 
                    Undertale was probably one of the earliest things I was fixated on 
                    <i>(others being fallout and portal, weird combination ik),</i>     
                    but even up to this day, I still continue to love whatever Toby Fox pushes out.

                    <b><i>The most comprehensive look at both Undertale and Deltarune in a single video that I have watched.</i></b>
                    <br/><br/>
                    The thought of being able to hear their voice change throughout the video speaks lengths on how long the video took.
                    It also reminds you of the impact of both games to compel someone to finish a video as long as this. 
                    Highly recommended to watch it as the video also recommends some cool pieces of fan content too!
